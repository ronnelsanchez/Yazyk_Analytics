              Realtid Ltd is a London based company (86-90 Paul Street London, EC2A 4NE, United Kingdom) with UK Company Registration No 09510061. The company’s owner and Managing Director is Mr Edouard CN BALDE. Realtid Ltd has secondary offices at 209 rue du Faubourg Saint Denis, 75010 Paris and at 244 Fifth Avenue, New York City, NY 10001.
            </p>
            <p><b>Services providers &amp; Realtid Ltd</b></p>
            In return for the service performed, Realtid Ltd shall pay to the Service Provider a fee equivalent to the price agreed on with the Service Provider upon works start. If the deadline as agreed on upon works start is not respected by the Service Provider for any reason unless Force Majeure case*, a penalty will apply and the Customer shall pay 70% of the agreed fee to the Service Provider.
            <p></p>
            <p>
              The price shall be payable in the following manner: 100% within 60 days E.O.M. upon reception of the Service Provider’s invoice when Realtid Ltd’s customer(s) will have paid Realtid Ltd in full. The above sums shall be payable by bank transfer or via Electronic Money.
            </p>
            <p><b>Force Majeure case</b>*</p>
            Performance of all or part of the contractual obligations incumbent on the Parties under the terms herein shall be deferred in the event of force majeure. Force majeure means any event that the Parties could not be expected to foresee, that is entirely beyond the control of the defaulting Party, and that prevents the obligations of the Agreement from being performed as originally intended. The Parties agree that the following in particular shall be considered cases of force majeure: war riots, fire, strike, inability to procure, and general transportation stoppage.<p></p>
            <p>In the event of force majeure, as defined above, the invocating Party shall give notice to the other Party by registered letter with bill of receipt, email with bill or receipt or by telex or facsimile transmission within eight days of the event. In the event of deferral, the term of the Agreement shall be extended accordingly.
            </p>
            <p><b>Realtid Ltd and its customers</b></p>
            A Non-Disclosure Agreement can be signed upon request between the customers and Realtid Ltd. Our business developers, project managers and consultants always sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement when starting working with Realtid Ltd. Realtid Ltd cannot be held responsible in case of insatisfaction from a customer whatever the amount involved in any project in relation with our services.<p></p>
            <p>Once the customer agrees on our quote(s) or commercial offer(s) – hence confirming an order or if he sends in a validated order form – he therefore agrees and accepts fully our terms and conditions. Furthermore, the customer cannot modify the delivered works but can add and/or send to Realtid Ltd comments separately whenever needed.
            </p>
            <p>Customers are to pay Realtid Ltd upon every confirmed order by bank transfer or via Electronic Money (above €500.00 per transaction the Customer shall pay half of transaction fees in addition to the invoiced amount). Payment terms are 50% upon ordering and 50% upon delivery or within 30 days E.O.M. upon invoicing (at delivery) in case of a specific arrangement between Realtid Ltd and the customer. Late payments will automatically incur a fixed fee of €40.00 payable within 10 days. Failure to pay the late payment fees will automatically put an end to commercial relations between Realtid Ltd and its customers. Minimum orders are €100.00 (per language pair) unless a specific arrangement has been made. Prices can be changed by Realtid Ltd without notice.
            </p>
